<div>Keep relative structure for folders.
    <p>Keeps behavior that was enabled by default between 0.9 and 0.11.
        Imagine that you have simple structure:
    <pre>
        tests
        -- a
        ---- results
        -- b
        ---- results
    </pre>
    If checkbox is checked and you specifed tests/* as a parameters, plugin will upload it to tests/a/results...tests/b/results.
    If this checkbox is disabled, plugin will upload it as a/results...b/results.
    </p>
    Pay attention - this option will be removed in next releases. So, it's better to avoid using it.
