    Post build steps are extendable by plugins and may be shell script, Windows batch, Maven, Ant or some other
    steps. You may define multiple steps for each build result. The steps will only be
    executed, if the build status is at least one of the selected build
    results. Using the control or command key, you can select multiple entries.
