    To reduce manual interventions by Administrators, most scripts should run in a Groovy Sandbox by default.
    The sandbox only allows a subset of Groovyâ€™s methods deemed sufficiently safe for "untrusted" access to be
    executed without prior approval. When a script attempts to use features or methods unauthorized by the sandbox,
    a script is halted immediately.
