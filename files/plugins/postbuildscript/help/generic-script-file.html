    Generic script files are shell or Windows batch script files that will be executed by the
    underlying operating system of the Jenkins node. Each entry can be assigned to a specific build
    result. The script files will only be executed, if the build status is at least one of the selected build
    results. Using the control or command key, you can select multiple entries.
